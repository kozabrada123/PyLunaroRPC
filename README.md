## Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+
* Discord
* Warframe to play lunaro

<br/>

* **Currently running on Linux is a bit of a pain, because Keyboard needs Sudo**

## Getting Started

- First, download or git clone this repo.
- Install the python requirements with `pip3 -r requirements.txt`.
- You're done!

## Usage:

- Start the program with `python3 main.py` (or `python main.py`)
- (**Make sure to launch LunaroRPC before Warframe**)
- Launch Warframe
- Go into a game of lunaro
- Press 'o' (default hotkey, configurable in settings.py) while holding TAB
- If nothing broke, game info should be processed and displayed on your profile.

## Troubleshooting and common issues:

- `No package .. was found` - This means one of your requirements isn't properly installed.


- If it doesn't show Lunaro as a running game on Discord, try turning game activity on and off.


- Discord SDK Error 4 - this is an **internal server error on Discord's servers**. Usually, LunaroRPC keeps working.

- Problems with requirements - There might be a mismatch between your python and pip. Try running `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` or `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.


## TO-DO And Future Updates To Expect

-**At least basic UI**

- Windows binary (Soon TM)

**â†‘ I've tried working on both of these, but I don't have any experience with either.**
